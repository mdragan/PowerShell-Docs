# about_Return
## TOPIC  
 about\_Return  
  
## SHORT DESCRIPTION  
 Exits the current scope, which can be a function, script, or script block.  
  
## LONG DESCRIPTION  
 The Return keyword exits a function, script, or script block. It can be used to exit a scope at a specific point, to return a value, or to indicate that the end of the scope has been reached.  
  
 Users who are familiar with languages like C or C\# might want to use the Return keyword to make the logic of leaving a scope explicit.  
  
 In [!INCLUDE[wps_1]()], the results of each statement are returned as output, even without a statement that contains the Return keyword. Languages like C or C\# return only the value or values that are specified by the Return keyword.  
  
### SYNTAX  
 The syntax for the Return keyword is as follows:  
  
```  
return [<expression>]  
```  
  
 The Return keyword can appear alone, or it can be followed by a value or expression, as follows:  
  
```  
return  
return $a  
return (2 + $a)  
```  
  
### EXAMPLES  
 The following example uses the Return keyword to exit a function at a specific point if a conditional is met:  
  
```  
function ScreenPassword($instance)  
{  
    if (!($instance.screensaversecure)) {return $instance.name}   
    <additional statements>  
}  
  
foreach ($a in @(get-wmiobject win32_desktop)) { ScreenPassword($a) }  
```  
  
 This script checks each user account. The ScreenPassword function returns the name of any user account that does not have a password\-protected screen saver. If the screen saver is password protected, the function completes any other statements to be run, and [!INCLUDE[wps_2]()] does not return any value.  
  
```  
$a  
return  
```  
  
 The following statement also returns the value of $a:Insert section body here.  
  
```  
return $a  
```  
  
 The following example includes a statement intended to let the user know that the function is performing a calculation:  
  
```  
function calculation {  
    param ($value)  
  
    "Please wait. Working on calculation..."  
    $value += 73  
    return $value  
    }  
```  
  
 Running this function and assigning the result to a variable has the following effect:  
  
```  
C:\PS> $a = calculation 14  
C:\PS>  
```  
  
 The "Please wait. Working on calculation..." string is not displayed. Instead, it is assigned to the $a variable, as in the following example:  
  
```  
C:\PS> $a  
Please wait. Working on calculation...  
87  
```  
  
 Both the informational string and the result of the calculation are returned by the function and assigned to the $a variable.
