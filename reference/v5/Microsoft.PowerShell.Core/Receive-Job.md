## DESCRIPTION
The Receive-Job cmdlet gets the results of Windows PowerShell background jobs, such as those started by using the Start-Job cmdlet or the AsJob parameter of any cmdlet.
You can get the results of all jobs or identify jobs by their name, ID, instance ID, computer name, location, or session, or by submitting a job object.

When you start a Windows PowerShell background job, the job starts, but the results do not appear immediately.
Instead, the command returns an object that represents the background job.
The job object contains useful information about the job, but it does not contain the results.
This method lets you continue to work in the session while the job runs.
For more information about background jobs in Windows PowerShell, see about_Jobs.

The Receive-Job cmdlet gets the results that have been generated by the time that the Receive-Job command is submitted.
If the results are not yet complete, you can run additional Receive-Job commands to get the remaining results.

By default, job results are deleted from the system when you receive them, but you can use the Keep parameter to save the results so that you can receive them again.
To delete the job results, run the Receive-Job command again without the Keep parameter, close the session, or use the Remove-Job cmdlet to delete the job from the session.

Starting in Windows PowerShell 3.0, Receive-Job also gets the results of custom job types, such as workflow jobs and instances of scheduled jobs.
To enable Receive-Job to get the results a custom job type, import the module that supports the custom job type into the session before it runs a Receive-Job command, either by using the Import-Module cmdlet or by using or getting a cmdlet in the module.
For information about a particular custom job type, see the documentation of the custom job type feature.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Get results for a particular job
```
PS C:\>$job = Start-Job -ScriptBlock {Get-Process}
PS C:\>Receive-Job -Job $job
```

These commands use the Job parameter of Receive-Job to get the results of a particular job.

The first command uses the Start-Job cmdlet to start a job that runs a Get-Process command.
The command uses the assignment operator (=) to save the resulting job object in the $job variable.

The second command uses the Receive-Job cmdlet to get the results of the job.
It uses the Job parameter to specify the job.

### Example 2: Get results for a particular job by using the pipeline
```
PS C:\>$job = Start-Job -ScriptBlock {Get-Process}
PS C:\>$job | Receive-Job
```

This example is the same as the previous example, except that the command uses a pipeline operator (|) to send the job object to Receive-Job.
As a result, the command does not need a Job parameter to specify the job.

### Example 3: Get results of several background jobs
```
The first command uses the Invoke-Command cmdlet to start a background job that runs a Get-Service command on three remote computers. The command uses the AsJob parameter to run the command as a background job. The command saves the resulting job object in the $j variable.When you use the AsJob parameter of Invoke-Command to start a job, the job object is created on the local computer, even though the job runs on the remote computers. As a result, you use local commands to manage the job.Also, when you use AsJob, Windows PowerShell returns one job object that contains a child job for each job that was started. In this case, the job object contains three child jobs, one for each job on each remote computer.


PS C:\>$j = Invoke-Command -ComputerName Server01, Server02, Server03 -ScriptBlock {Get-Service} -AsJob

The second command uses the dot method to display the value of the ChildJobs property of the job object in $j. The display shows that the command created three child jobs, one for the job on each remote computer.
PS C:\>$j.ChildJobs

Id   Name     State      HasMoreData   Location       Command
--   ----     -----      -----------   --------       -------
2    Job2     Completed  True          Server01       Get-Service
3    Job3     Completed  True          Server02       Get-Service
4    Job4     Completed  True          Server03       Get-Service

The third command uses the Receive-Job cmdlet to get the results of the Job3 child job that ran on the Server02 computer. It uses the Name parameter to specify the name of the child job and the Keep parameter to save the job results even after they are received.
PS C:\>Receive-Job -Name Job3 -Keep

Status  Name        DisplayName                        PSComputerName
------  ----------- -----------                        --------------
Running AeLookupSvc Application Experience             Server02
Stopped ALG         Application Layer Gateway Service  Server02
Running Appinfo     Application Information            Server02
Running AppMgmt     Application Management             Server02
```

These commands get the results of one of several background jobs run on remote computers.

### Example 4: Get results of background jobs on multiple remote computers
```
The first command uses the New-PSSession cmdlet to create three user-managed sessions (PSSessions), one on each of the servers specified in the command. It saves the sessions in the $s variable.
PS C:\>$s = new-pssession -computername Server01, Server02, Server03

The second command uses the Invoke-Command cmdlet to run a Start-Job command in each of the PSSessions in the $s variable. The job runs a Get-EventLog command that gets the events in the System log. The command saves the results in the $j variable.Because the command used Invoke-Command to run the Start-Job command, the command actually started three independent jobs on each of the three computers. As a result, the command returned three job objects representing three jobs run locally on three different computers.
PS C:\>$j = invoke-command -session $s -scriptblock {start-job -scriptblock {get-eventlog -logname system}}

The third command displays the three job objects in $j.
PS C:\>$j

Id   Name     State      HasMoreData   Location   Command
--   ----     -----      -----------   --------   -------
1    Job1     Completed  True          Localhost  get-eventlog system
2    Job2     Completed  True          Localhost  get-eventlog system
3    Job3     Completed  True          Localhost  get-eventlog system


The fourth command uses Invoke-Command to run a Receive-Job command in each of the sessions in $s and save the results in the $Results variable.Because $j is a local variable, the script block uses the Using scope modifier to identify the $j variable. For more information about the Using scope modifier, see about_Remote_Variables (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=252653).
PS C:\>$results = Invoke-Command -Session $s -ScriptBlock {Receive-Job -Job $Using:j}
```

This example shows how to get the results of background jobs run on three remote computers.
