SHORT DESCRIPTION  
    Explains limitations of Windows PowerShell 3.0 on Windows RT 8.  
  
LONG DESCRIPTION  
    The Windows RT 8 operating system is installed on computers  
    and devices (such as Microsoft Surface, on which it is the  
    operating system that ships with the computer) that use Advanced  
    RISC Machine (ARM) processors.  
  
    Windows PowerShell 3.0 is included in Windows RT 8. All cmdlets,  
    providers, and modules, and most scripts designed for Windows   
    PowerShell 2.0 and later releases run on Windows RT 8   
    without changes.  
  
    Because Windows RT 8 does not include all Windows features,   
    some Windows PowerShell features work differently or do   
    not work on Windows RT-based devices. The following list  
    explains the differences.  
  
    -- Windows PowerShell ISE is not included in and cannot run   
       on Windows RT 8. Windows PowerShell ISE requires Windows  
       Presentation Foundation, which is not included in   
       Windows RT 8.  
  
    -- Windows PowerShell remoting and the WinRM service   
       are disabled by default. To enable remoting, run the   
       Enable-PSRemoting cmdlet. Also, run the Set-Service  
       cmdlet to set the startup type of the WinRM service   
       to Automatic, or Automatic (Delayed Start).  
  
       While remoting is disabled, you can use Windows PowerShell  
       remoting to run commands on other computers, but other   
       computers cannot run commands on the Windows RT device.  
       Also, implicit remoting—that is, remoting that is built in  
       to a cmdlet or script, and not explicitly requested with added  
       parameters—does not work in Windows PowerShell running on  
       Windows RT 8.  
  
    -- Domain-joined computing and Kerberos authentication are   
       not supported on Windows RT 8. You cannot use Windows PowerShell  
       to add or manage these features.  
  
    -- Microsoft .NET Framework classes that are not supported   
       on Windows RT 8 are also not supported by Windows PowerShell  
       on Windows RT 8.  
  
    -- Transactions are not enabled on Windows RT 8. Transaction  
       cmdlets, such as Start-Transaction, and transaction   
       parameters, such as UseTransaction, do not work properly.  
  
    -- All Windows PowerShell sessions on Windows RT 8 devices use  
       the ConstrainedLanguage language mode. ConstrainedLanguage language  
       mode is a companion to User Mode Code Integrity (UMCI). It permits  
       all Windows cmdlets and Windows PowerShell language elements, but  
       restricts types to ensure that users cannot use Windows PowerShell  
       to circumvent or violate the UMCI protections.  
  
       For more information about ConstrainedLanguage language mode, see   
       about_Language_Modes.
